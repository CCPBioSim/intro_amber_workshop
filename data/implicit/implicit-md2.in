run restrained MD at 300K
&cntrl
  ntc=2, ! shake constraints, bonds with H constrained
  ntf=2, ! typically ntf = ntc
  cut=12.0, ! non-bond cutoff (Angstroms)
  igb=1, ! generalized Born model
  gbsa=1, ! surface area using LCPO model
  saltcon=0.1, ! salt concentration (M), Debye-Huckel screening
  ntpr=500, ! frequency of writing to mdout/mdinfo
  ntwx=500, ! frequency of writing to mdcrd
  nstlim=5000, ! number of MD steps
  dt=0.002, ! time step (ps)
  ntt=1, ! temperature coupling, weak-coupling algorithm
  temp0=300.0, ! reference temperature
  ntx=5,  ! coordinates and velocities read in
  irest=1, ! restart = coordinates and velocities from input file
  nscm=1000, ! removal of translational and rotational center of mass
  ntr=1, ! using restraints
  restraint_wt=1.0, ! weight for the positional restraints (kcal/mol-A^2)
  restraintmask=':1-5' ! string which specifies which atoms are restrained
